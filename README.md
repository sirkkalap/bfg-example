# bfg-example

This small script demonstrates using https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/ 

The script generates a repository, adds a public and secret file to it, makes some copies of files, adds a branch and uses BFG
to strip the secret and its copies from the repository.

This can be used as training material learning how to make a private repository public while maintaining history.
